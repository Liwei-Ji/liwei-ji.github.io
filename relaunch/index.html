    <h1>The Journey to Rebuild My Portfolio</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- 內文 -->
  <div class="text">
    <p>For years, I’ve been searching for the best way to showcase my work and professional skills, but I’ve realized it’s time for a change. My journey started with <strong>Behance</strong>, a platform that is simple and easy to use, making it perfect for uploading design work. However, as my needs grew, I found that Behance could no longer meet them. It lacked the customization flexibility I needed, limiting my imagination on how to present my work.</p>

    <p>Later, I tried using <strong>Notion</strong> to organize my portfolio. Notion is indeed a great tool for note-taking and organization, allowing me to present my creative journey in a more structured way. But it lacks interactivity, and the user experience is nowhere near that of a professional website. This made me realize: perhaps I need a truly personal online stage.</p>

    <p>I wanted a platform that integrates all my resources, connecting professional articles and personal insights scattered across <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, and other platforms. Each of these platforms is great in its own way, but they are separate and don't fully represent my professional image. A unified website would allow visitors to get a more comprehensive understanding of me, offering a richer and more in-depth content experience.</p>

    <p>More importantly, I hope the website evolves as I grow. It’s not just a static portfolio, but a reflection of my career journey, showcasing my commitment to continuous improvement. Each update represents another step forward in my professional development.</p>

    <p><strong>Therefore, the rebuilding process is not just a technical upgrade, but an investment in self-improvement, a journey towards excellence.</strong></p>
