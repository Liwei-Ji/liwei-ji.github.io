        <h1>OPTEX Vision App</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2> 
        <p>The OPTEX Vision App is an innovative application designed to connect to the OPTEX surveillance system, offering users real-time video streaming, event recording, and live notifications. It allows residential and commercial users to intuitively and securely manage their video surveillance remotely</p>
        <h2>What our Japanese partner has done with me…</h2>   
        <h3>Japanese Partner</h3> 
        <p>OPTEX (オプテックス株式会社) is a brand specializing in sensing technology, headquartered in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, and was established in 1979. It is known for providing high-performance sensing solutions, and its products are widely used in fields such as security, building automation, and traffic control</p>  
        <h3>Involvement</h3> 
        <ul> 
        <li>User Research</li>
        <p>I collaborated with the OPTEX Japanese partner to conduct in-depth interviews, gathering their insights on the Japanese and European markets as well as user needs</p> 
        <li>Design Planning</li>
        <p>Responsible for process design and creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, focusing on simplifying navigation logic to ensure users can quickly grasp the operations</p>  
        </ul>  
        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>The design concept focuses on combining convenience, connectivity, and interactivity to create a seamless user experience</p>  
        
        <h2>Insight</h2>
        <p>When designing the OPTEX Vision App, we adhered to OPTEX's consistent brand style, using minimalist design philosophy as the core principle, presenting a perfect blend of brand image and user experience</p>   
          
         <h2>Prototype</h2>
         <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
         <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
          
         <h2>Results</h2>
         <p>In this project, I closely collaborated with the team to conduct user research and deeply analyze the needs and pain points of the target market</p>
          
         <p>Ultimately, we successfully launched the OPTEX Vision App and it was released on schedule in the<strong> Japanese and European markets</strong></p> 
         <p>The OPTEX Vision App enhanced the surveillance experience, successfully meeting users' needs for real-time video monitoring and remote operation</strong></p>  
          
         <p>Thank you for reading until the end.</p>
