        <h2>Background</h2> 
        <p>With the rapid adoption of 5G and millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology, antenna testing and performance optimization have become key elements in the development of communication devices. However, current antenna testing solutions face the following challenges:</p>
        <h3>Complex Testing Process, Low Efficiency</h3> 
        <p>Traditional GUI systems often lack real-time feedback features, making it difficult for users to quickly assess antenna performance during testing. Multiple tests and adjustments are required, leading to low testing efficiency.</p>  
        <h3>High Threshold for Multi-Parameter Debugging</h3> 
        <p>mmmWave antennas require adjustments to multiple variables (such as frequency, gain, power output, etc.). Existing tools lack automation and template support when setting multiple parameters. Beginners need to constantly refer to manuals, leading to a steep learning curve.</p>   
        <h3>Insufficient Data Visualization</h3>
        <p>Many existing systems only support static 2D graphical displays, making it impossible to fully present the spatial performance of millimeter-wave antennas. As a result, engineers find it difficult to quickly identify design flaws from test data.</p>   
        <h3>Limited Cross-Platform Support</h3>
        <p>Most solutions can only operate on specific operating systems (such as Windows), limiting user flexibility and causing inconvenience for teams that need cross-device collaboration.</p>  
          
        <h2>My Impact</h2>
        <p>By deeply analyzing these pain points, I designed an innovative mmWave testing GUI that addresses the challenges mentioned above and improves the user experience. This tool not only optimizes the testing process but also incorporates a modular design and real-time data visualization features, significantly reducing the learning curve and improving efficiency. This innovation ultimately succeeded in obtaining patents<strong>（TWD227352S, TWD228798S, TWD228799S）</strong>and provided the industry with a brand-new solution</p>  
          
        <h2>What Did I Do?</h2>
        <h3>Conceptualization</h3>
            
        <h3>Real-Time Data Visualization</h3>
        <p>In antenna testing, data-driven metrics such as antenna gain patterns and frequency response curves are often used. Real-time visualization allows users to intuitively understand the changes in antenna performance during testing</p>  
        <h3>Multi-Parameter Test Setup</h3>
        <p>mmWave antennas involve multiple variables (such as frequency, power, phase shift). By providing preset templates and custom options, the tool is easy to use for both beginners and advanced users</p>
        <h3>Modular Design</h3>
        <p>Through a modular interface, users can add features as needed, such as testing specific frequency bands or measuring different types of antennas</p>     
        <h3>Cross-Platform Compatibility</h3>  
        <p><strong>Reduced</strong>the limitation of running on specific operating systems, improving flexibility</p>  
        
        <h2>Research Methods and Insights</h2>
        <p>Survey Collection</p>
        <p>User Research</p>   
        <p>I designed a survey to ask potential users, such as "What do you think is the biggest challenge in using mmWave GUI?" with options provided for ranking</p>
        <p>Data Collection and Analysis</p>   
        <p>Existing user feedback data can be categorized and statistically analyzed to understand the frequency of mentions for various pain points</p>
        <p>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</p>  
        <p>I used low-fidelity wireframes to discuss the logical structure with engineers, gaining insights into potential obstacles during the operation</p>  
          
          
        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>  
        <blockquote>
            「Due to the confidentiality agreement, the process will not be disclosed」
        </blockquote>  
          
        <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
        <p>In the critical design phase, low-fidelity prototypes were used to quickly validate concepts and user workflows</p>   
        <p>Through simplified graphics and interface simulations, the focus was on validating user interaction logic and core functionality, ensuring that the design direction met user needs and was feasible</p>    
        <ul> 
        <li>Quickly validate interface design logic and reduce the risk of design errors</li>
        <li>Collect real user feedback through usability testing, continuously improving iterations</li>
        <li>Ensure seamless integration with engineers' technical implementations</li>  
        </ul>    
        <p>Construction</p>  
        <p>I used hand-drawn sketches to create basic interface simulations that demonstrate the flow of data input, parameter setup, and result presentation</p>   
        <p>Testing</p> 
        <p>The low-fidelity prototype was given to potential users for operation, recording any issues and suggestions encountered during use. The main points of observation included</p>   
        <ul> 
        <li>Is the functionality easy to understand and operate?</li>
        <li>Are there any non-intuitive interface layouts?</li>
        <li>Does it accurately express the design goals?</li>  
        </ul>    
        <p>Process</p>
        <p>Defined the real-time data visualization graphics display to make the test data more intuitive</p>

        <h2>Prototype Iteration Process</h2>
        <p>Analyzed competing products in the market that lack a complete multi-parameter adjustment and visualization interface</p>  
        <p>During the design process of real-time data visualization, I always focused on one core question：<strong>How to maximize the value of data visualization?</strong></p>   
        <p>To solve this problem, I used multiple graphical iterations, gradually enhancing the depth and intuitiveness of data presentation</p>   
  
        <h3>2D Radar Chart</h3>
        <p>As an initial attempt, the 2D radar chart effectively displayed data directionality and gain characteristics. However, it was limited to a flat presentation, unable to represent more complex spatial relationships</p>   
        <h3>3D Modeling</h3>
        <p>I further converted the data into a three-dimensional structure, adding a depth dimension. This allowed for complete spatial distribution visualization, significantly improving the user's efficiency and accuracy in understanding the data</p>   
        <p>Through this design evolution, I not only addressed the limitations of data presentation but also provided users with a brand-new visualization experience, making abstract data more vivid and easier to operate</p>  
          
        <h2>2D Radar Chart</h2>
        <p>Displays basic 2D radar charts with flat data and directionality</p>

        <p>By adding data depth, it fully presents spatial characteristics, allowing users to intuitively view mmWave locations</p>

        <h2>Results</h2> 
        <p>After implementing this design, test engineers reported that the testing time was reduced by an average of 20 minutes, directly saving about 10 hours of testing time per week</p>  
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <ul> 
        <li>The modular design reduced the difficulty of operation for test engineers (by 90%)</li>
        <li>3D modeling reduced data misreading rate (by 25%)</li>
        </ul>   
        
        <h3>Function Comparison</h3>  

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
