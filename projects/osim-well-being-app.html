        <h1>Smooth Integration Between Different Products</h1>
        <h2>What Difference Did Make?</h2>
        <ul> 
        <li>Easy to Use and Control</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>Simplifying the control interface and adding smart reminder features, users were able to control the massage product more easily. As a result, user satisfaction with this feature reached an impressive<strong> 80% </strong>positive feedback rate.</p>
        <ul> 
        <li>Building the OSIM Health Ecosystem to Improve User Wellness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By integrating multiple OSIM products—such as the eye massager, foot massager, and combining them into a discreet massage chair—we successfully created a connected health ecosystem. This not only enhanced the user experience but also promoted seamless, cross-product integration, allowing users to enjoy a more holistic and efficient wellness routine.</p>
          
        <h2>How I did it…</h2>
        <h3>Why Synergy Is Needed?</h3>  
        
        <p>Health management is no longer limited to a single product. By connecting OSIM devices like the eye massager, foot massager, and gaming massage chair, we’ve created the "invisible massage chair." This cross-product integration makes the devices work together seamlessly, offering more complete and personalized health support.</p>
        <ul>  
        <li>Eye massager + massage chair</li>   
        <li>Eye and foot massager + gaming massage chair</li>    
        </ul>  
        <h2>How Can We Make a Difference?</h2>
        <p>To overcome the challenges, we first had a discussion with the product owner, breaking down the requirements in detail to ensure both sides had a shared understanding of ticketing goals and user experience. We then defined two key objectives:</p>
        <ul>  
        <li>Unify the interface and operation design to ensure a consistent user experience.</li> 
        <li>Allow users to create customized massage combinations.</li> 
        </ul>  
        <h2>Discuss</h2> 
        <p>Since there is already an established interface and logic for single-product operation, during the process of designing combinations, we first reviewed the current logic and differences.</p>
        
        <h2>Similar Logic - Continuation</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Dashboard Status Display (Product, Battery)</li> 
        <li>Body Tension</li>  
        <li>Manual Mix & Match</li>
        <li>Recommended Massage Programs</li>    
        <li>Auto Programs</li> 
        <li>Manual Programs</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>Difference in Logic: How to connect combined products?</p> 
        <li>Bluetooth connection</li>  
        <li>Save combined products</li>    
          
        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>  
        <p>With each exploration, I focused on building prototypes providing divergent frames and having them immerse</p>  
          
        <h2>Components</h2>   
          
        <h2>Results</h2>   
        <p>Sit, connect and enjoy a full body massage on any chair</p>
