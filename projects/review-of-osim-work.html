        <h1>Review of My Role and Projects as UI/UX Designer at OSIM</h1>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>During my time as a Senior UI/UX Designer at OSIM in Singapore, I was mainly responsible for the design of <strong>OneCRM</strong> (a customer feedback system) and the <strong>OSIM Well-Being App</strong>(for small massage products and gaming massage chairs), focusing on improving the overall user experience for OSIM customers worldwide</p>
        <p>Throughout this experience, I was deeply involved in the full design process, from requirements analysis to interaction design. By understanding user needs in depth, I was able to create intuitive and efficient solutions that significantly improved product usability and user satisfaction</p>

        <blockquote>
            「Due to the confidentiality agreement, the process will not be disclosed」
        </blockquote>  
          
        <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>I worked closely with the stakeholders to discuss requirements, break down business goals and user needs, and prioritize tasks while planning delivery timelines. Based on this, I worked on the interaction design and collaborated with the design team for reviews to ensure the solutions aligned perfectly with the needs</p>
        <p>In the end, the design not only met business objectives but also provided clear, actionable guidance, helping the team implement it smoothly</p>  
        
        <h2>Project Review</h2>
        <h3>OneCRM</h3>
        <li>Provide a management platform for OSIM's customer service teams worldwide, making it easy to handle user feedback.</li>
        <li>Allow customer service to respond to user issues quickly</li>
        <li>Measure the speed and quality of customer service</li>
        <li>Build OSIM wellbeing ecosystem to improve OSIM users' health</li>  
        <h3>OSIM Well-Being App</h3>
        <li>Ease use and control</li>
        <li>Build OSIM wellbeing ecosystem to improve OSIM users' health</li>   
        <h3>Small Project</h3>
        <li>WeChat Mini Program</li> 
        <li>O-Mall (Online Store)</li> 
        <li>OTO (OnlineTo Offline)</li> 
        <h3>Knowledge Sharing</h3>
          
        <h2>Research Methods</h2>  
        <p>Below are the methods for verification</p>   
        <li>A/B Test</li>   
        <li>POC</li>     
        <li>Data Analysis</li>      
        <li>Surveys</li>      
        <li>Field Research</li>   
          
        <h2>Collaboration and Communication</h2>    
        <p>Even with the remote work setup, the team maintained efficient collaboration. Through regular online meetings and instant messaging, we were able to quickly align on requirements, clarify goals, and set priorities, ensuring the design direction stayed in sync with business needs. Brainstorming sessions and design reviews with the product manager, development team, and other designers helped ensure the design not only met user needs but also addressed business challenges effectively</p>  
        <p>This collaboration strengthened cross-department coordination and facilitated quick problem-solving, ensuring the design could adapt to changes and meet set goals. Additionally, working closely with the customer service and training teams in the Taipei office helped ensure the design supported the frontline team and addressed real user needs.</p>
          
        <h2>Growth</h2>    
        <p>Over my two-plus years at OSIM, I designed the OneCRM and Well-Being App, which deepened my understanding of the strategy behind massage products. This experience allowed me to create solutions for complex requirements while working closely across departments and iterating based on continuous user feedback. Through constant refinement, I achieved a balance between business goals and user needs. These challenges heightened my awareness of market changes and greatly boosted my confidence in design direction and innovation</p>
