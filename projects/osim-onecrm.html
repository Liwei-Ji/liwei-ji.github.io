        <h1>How I Helped the CS Team Increase Efficiency</h1>
        <img src="https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/fs/025bcf220700705.67c7d3826b72f.png" alt="osim" class="inline-image">        
        <h2>What Difference Did Make?</h2>
        <h3>Improved Customer Service Efficiency</h3> 
        <p>Through the OneCRM platform, we reduced the average time it took for customer service to handle each feedback, from<strong> 4 minutes </strong>to<strong> 2 minutes</strong>, significantly improving the team's efficiency</p>
        <h3>Faster Customer Responses</h3> 
        <p>According to internal data, customer satisfaction increased by 30%, demonstrating the significant impact of OneCRM in enhancing the quality and speed of customer service responses</p>  
        <h3>Ability to Measure CSO Service Speed and Quality</h3> 
        <h3>Improve apps and products based on user feedback collected</h3>   
        <p>The not only improved customer service workflows but also offered valuable data insights. These insights helped the product team identify and address pain points from user feedback, leading to product optimizations</p>  
        <h3>Reduce other service costs</h3>   
        <blockquote>
            「Due to the confidentiality agreement, the process will not be disclosed」
        </blockquote>  
          
        <h2>How I did it…</h2>
        <h3>Why Synergy Is Needed?</h3>  
        <p>It is easy CS team to communicate and resolve the issues filed by customers through Osim Well-Being Mobile App Feedback function</p> 
        <p>It provides functions such as:</p>
        <ul>  
        <li>Managing and queuing different feedbacks from customer with priority set</li>   
        <li>Having the capability to communicate with customer on the fly during working hour</li>
        <li>Campaigns features - send /schedule notification to be sent to customer’s device</li>  
        </ul>   
        <h2>How Can Make a Difference?</h2>
          
        <h2>Timeline</h2> 
        <p>To tackle these challenges, we first had detailed discussions with the product owner to break down the requirements and make sure we were all on the same page about the business goals and user needs. This helped us identify two main objectives</p>   
        <ul>  
        <li>Integrating the feedback feature from the app with OneCRM Users can now submit feedback anytime directly through the app, without having to wait for business hours to reach customer service. This made users happier and helped us deliver service more efficiently.</li>   
        <li>Using feedback data to track user pain points by gathering and looking at this feedback, we can spot areas where the product can improve. Plus, the data can be shared with the marketing team, giving them valuable insights to help with future marketing strategies and product update</li>
        </ul>     
        <h2>Feature Discussion</h2>   
        <p>Since remote work, I usually make a lot of flowcharts and wireframes, and then dive into them with the product owner or other designers. This helps us get clear on the design ideas and make quick changes during the process, making sure every design decision stays on track with what we want to achieve</p>  
          
       <p>Thank you for reading until the end.</p>
